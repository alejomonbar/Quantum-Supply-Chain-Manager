# Quantum-Supply-Chain-Manager
The quantum supply chain manager is a quantum solution for logistics problems. We use the power of quantum machine learning for product [backorder](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backorder.asp) prediction and quantum optimization for finding the best route to pick those products with high demand to store them in strategic warehouses. With the first technique, our clients can be prepared for increasing the production of their products when they are in high demand. Once we have established a set of products needed during a period of time, we use our second solution, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) solution to find the optimal route for picking these products. This reduces considerably costs associated with logistics, transportation, backorders, and overstocking for our clients. In summary, these solutions will improve business in terms of client satisfaction, backorder and shipping transportation costs.
